<h1>Hey there! I'm Ras (@rxsyu) 👋🏻</h1>

— and I'm delighted to welcome you to my GitHub profile and repository! 💻

My passion lies in **crafting captivating user interfaces and delightful user experiences for iOS apps**. Alongside that, I have a deep fascination with all things **JavaScript**, and I thoroughly enjoy working on **frontend website development projects** with **React.js** and **Next.js**.

Color plays a vital role in my design process, and I have a soft spot for the mesmerizing #f4f4f5 and #18181b color combination. Alternatively, I find myself drawn to the bold and distinctive appeal of brutalist color combos.

Currently, I'm diving headfirst into the world of React.js and Next.js, striving to expand my knowledge and expertise in these technologies. It's an exciting journey, and I can't wait to see how it elevates my future projects! Speaking of which, I'm actively engaged in building a website for a police department in Indonesia, codenamed "**SIGAP**". It's a project close to my heart, allowing me to utilize my UI/UX design skills and frontend development prowess for a meaningful cause.

If you're interested, do check out the list of repositories in my profile - they're all about React.js and Next.js frontend projects. I hope you find them helpful and inspiring!<br><br><br><br>Let's connect and collaborate!
